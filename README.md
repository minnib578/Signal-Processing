# Signal-Processing

In this project, we used Ultrasonic Sensor to detect the distance between objects and sensor with Kalman Filter, and there are three goals needed to be implemented:

* Use one ultrasonic sensor and the Kalman filter to determine the distance to an object

* Use two ultrasonic sensors and Kalman filter to detect the distance between sensors and objects with sensor fusion algorithm 

* Use two ultrasonic sensors to determine the location of an object in the X-Y plane
